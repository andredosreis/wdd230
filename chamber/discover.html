                Leiria has a river that flows uphill, a tower that has no cathedral, a cathedral that has no tower, and a Straight Street that is not straight. (Popular Rhyme).

                For King Afonso Henriques, the first Christian conqueror of Leiria in 1135 and the founder of its castle, the location was the advanced sentinel for his strategy of conquering Santarém, Sintra and Lisbon from the Moors, which would happen in 1147.
                
                For more than half a century, Leiria would be devastated again by the incursions of Moorish armies and its definitive conquest would only happen in the reign of King Sancho I at the end of the 12th century, giving the monarch the charter in 1195.
                
                In 1254, King Afonso III held here the first Courts with the presence of all the representatives of the councils of the Kingdom, a fact of extreme importance in the History of Portugal, because it was the first time that the people could express their claims to the King.
                
                In the 14th century, King Dinis and especially his wife Queen Isabel, the Holy Queen, resided several times in the castle, perhaps because they considered it a pleasant residence with wide views of the charms of the surrounding landscape.
                
                The king's action was marked by the implantation of the Leiria pine forest along the coastal area to protect the sand dunes. Its Scots pines would provide the wood and pitch for Portuguese shipbuilding, especially during the period of the Discoveries, and even today this immense green area is a very pleasant place for a walk.
                
                Of all the Courts held by the Portuguese monarchs in Leiria, the most tragic session would have occurred in 1438, convened by King Duarte to discuss the surrender of Ceuta in exchange for the release of his brother the Holy Infant, King Fernando, prisoner in Tangier. The Assembly decided on the sacrifice of the Infant in exchange for the maintenance of the Moroccan square and the king, devastated by grief, would die shortly after.
                
                From the medieval castle, the city grew outside the walls in a first period marked by the Romanesque Church of São Pedro and then in the 16th century with the construction of the Cathedral and the Misericórdia. The city then expanded to the Lis River and its leafy banks welcomed several religious buildings.
                
                But it was only in the 19th century that the city of Leiria would develop again with the establishment of the bourgeoisie, very well portrayed by Eça de Queirós, who imagines here the "Crime of Father Amaro", and especially by the action of Ernesto Korrodi, who was committed to enhancing the city. Since then and until today, modern and disorderly urbanization has changed the city, transforming it into an expanding industrial center.
